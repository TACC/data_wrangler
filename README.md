Utilities for data ETL:
The immediate need is to build a set of utilities to automate the ETL from a set of REDCap projects to a target postgres database. The longer term goal is to develop a library of utilities which will facilitate schema development, data validation, data reproducibility (via snapshots/versioning), and other common data management tasks across a broader data ecosystem.
