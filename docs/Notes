REDCap Export:
Automates the export of metadata, REDCap instrument reports, records that have been added/deleted/changed within a specified timeframe and project data via the REDCap API. 
The code must support the ETL of multiple instruments from multiple REDCap projects into common tables. 
For each project, the data_admin wants to select all or a subset of the reports and project data to export to a secure directory at a specified day and time.
The data_admin also wants the ability to select all or a subset of the reports and project data to export to a secure directory on demand.
The data_admin wants to be notified when the job completes or if an issue occurs preventing job completion.
The export application needs ability to reestablish a connection and reissue the incomplete job based on the return code so that the full ETL can be run successfully
unattended.

Test:
1) Initial validation of connections, permissions and existence of the specified project and reports.
2) Access to create a new directory within the secure storage where the exports will be stored.

REDCap Raw Data Transforms (CSVs)...For each exported CSV,
1) Strip CRLFs and formatting tags
2) If [instrument]_complete=NULL, delete the record
3) If [instrument]_complete=0 AND a select set of fields contain data, set [instrument]_complete=1 ELSE delete the record.
4) If a date/time field contains annotation other than a timestamp, set the field to blank and set [instrument]_complete=1.
5) Transform REDCap raw field_ids to target variable names. 

Steps 1, 4 & 5 must be done before loading data into the DW; 2 & 3 could be handled after the load. 
The report exports are formatted to expand multi-checkboxes into separate variables. The rcap_field_variable_map.csv and corresponding DW table were generated
using the REDCap exportFieldNames API method to export the CSV and adding a dw_variable_name column to provide the substituted variable name.
This table also provides the mapping for merged tables and interpretting labels and field attributes from the meta table. 

At this point, records associated with the previously imported data (same project/instrument/language) may be dropped, 
and the transformed CSV can be loaded into the corresponding table within the DW. 
6) Set project_id to the REDCap project_id (or the designated FK project_id within the project table).
7) Set last_updated_ts to the REDCap export timestamp (can be parsed from the REDCap exported file name).
8) If language other than "en", insert value (such as "sp") into the language variable.

Leveraging REDCap Metadata (aka Data Dictionary) for Schema Definition, Labels and Data Quality 

REDCap has a data dictionary for every project which can be exported in multiple formats including CSV and JSON. 
The resulting metadata export contains the raw instrument and field names and their labels.
It also contains the datatypes, calculations and quality control rules. The REDCap metadata export can be used to construct the table schemas 
for housing REDCap instrument data and provides a single location source for labeling views. Comparing a current metadata file against an existing one 
provides a mechanism for checking compatibility across datasets. 

The rcap_field_variable_map.csv table maps the REDCap metadata projects/instruments/field names to DW tables/variable names. The mapping and meta tables
can be leveraged to display the labels and to potentially autogenerate stata .do files and other formatted output.
