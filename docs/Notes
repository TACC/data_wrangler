REDCap Export:
Currently, 6/28/22, we have 65 REDCap instrument reports on the CTRN project to export via the REDCap API. 
Additional REDCap projects may be added at a future time. 
For each project, I (data administrator) want to select all or a subset of the reports to export to a secure directory at a specified day and time.
I also want to export a copy of the REDCap data dictionary (metadata file).
I'd like to be notified when the job completes or if an issue occurs preventing job completion.

1) Initial validation of connections, permissions and existence of the specified project and reports.
2) Access to create a new directory within the secure storage where the exports will be stored.

REDCap Raw Data Transforms (CSVs):
1) If [instrument]_complete=0 AND a select set of fields contain data, set [instrument]_complete=1
2) If a date/time field contains annotation other than a timestamp, set the field to blank and set [instrument]_complete=1.
3) If a field contains illegal formatting tags which could misalign the records, strip them.
4) If [instrument]_complete=NULL OR [instrument]_complete=0 (after handling transform step 1), delete the record.
5) Transform REDCap raw field_ids to target variable names.
6) Set project_id to REDCap project_id (or designated project name).
7) Set last_updated_ts to REDCap export timestamp (based on the REDCap exported file name).
8) Set language to indicate language other than "en".
